    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
        On March 12, 2022 the former RCB Skipper, Virat Kohli announced that he would be passing on the baton tow Faf du Plessis, who will be the new Captain for the RCB. It will be an all new setup, change in team colours for Faf du Plessis who will be representing the RCB the 2022 edition of the league. The veteran batter from South Africa was bought by the RCB for INR 7 crore at the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. Faf du Plessis started his IPL journey with the CSK and has played for them ever since. The right-handed batter played an all-important knock in the Finals of the 2021 edition of the league, scoring 86 runs off 59 deliveries, thereby winning the Player of the Match for the same. In 2018, Punjab Kings bought Faf for INR 1.6cr, but but CSK trumped them by using their RTM card and it sure was a bargain for them. While the classy and composed batsman did not get many outings in the RPS squad where he was picked up in the IPL player draft, du Plessis had consistent performances for CSK wherein he went on to have a very successful debut season scoring 398 runs. He impressed with a half-century on his ODI debut, against India and soon enough, found himself in South Africa’s squad for the 2011 World Cup. With a century on Test debut against Australia, du Plessis has shed the tag of a limited-overs specialist. Although batting remains his area of prowess, du Plessis can come up with a few handy leg-spinners when required. To boot that, he is a livewire in the field, hence, making him a perfect T20 package for any captain</p>
    <h2>Ruturaj Gaikwad Captain Of CSK</h2>

    <P>In December 2018, Gaikwad was bought by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the player auction for the 2019 Indian Premier League.[51][52]

        On 2 October 2021, Gaikwad scored his first IPL century, with 101 not out against the Rajasthan Royals in the 2021 tournament.[53] On 15 October, Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 27 runs in the finals with Gaikwad contributing to CSK's total by scoring 32 runs off 27 balls. He won the Orange Cap for scoring the most runs (635) in the 2021 tournament and was also awarded the Emerging Player of the Year award.[54]
        
        After his good performances in the 2021 season, Gaikwad was retained by Chennai Super Kings for ₹6 crores ahead of the 2022 IPL auction.[55]
        
        On March 21, 2024, Chennai Super Kings announced the appointment of Gaikwad as their captain. This decision followed the resignation of Mahendra Singh Dhoni from the captaincy role, a position he held for a remarkable 14 seasons. Dhoni's decision to step down occurred on the eve of the 17th IPL season, marking a significant transition in leadership for the franchise. Gaikwad's appointment as captain positioned him as the fourth individual to assume this prestigious role for the Chennai Super Kings.[56]

         <p>Sanju Samson came into reckoning with his gritty knocks for Rajasthan Royals in his debut season for the franchise.

Sanju scored 342 runs in IPL 2019 and then followed it up with 375 runs in the IPL 2020. He was moved into senior position when named captain for the 2021 season. Now that he is into his 2nd season as the leader of the pack and with the addition of some established seniors joining RR, one can surely hope for an improved show from this team.</p>

         <p>The fans of Lucknow Super Giants – the newest franchise in the IPL – will pin their hopes on this man as the team looks to set the ball rolling and make their mark in their maiden IPL season. LSG picked KL Rahul – one of the finest – batters of the modern era to the board via draft and made him their captain. While Rahul, who was earlier leading Punjab Kings, will have a new set of players at his disposal, he will be out to lead from the front and bring the best out of his new teammates. KL Rahul has over 3200 IPL runs to his name and his run-tally from the last four seasons (recent first) read: 626, 670, 593 and 659. The stylish yet destructive right-hander also holds the record for the highest individual score by an Indian batsman in the IPL. He has been a pillar for the Indian team across formats and it will not be any different when he sets foot on the field for LSG.</p>

         <p>Opener, Shubman Gill from Punjab, has drawn immense praise from all quarters after important contributions in India U19 side’s world cup win in 2018. He was acquired by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2018 and turned in useful contributions for them in his debut season and 2019 season. He was retained by the KKR team management who saw immense batting potential in him and even pegged him to be a part of their core leadership group. He made his ODI debut for India in New Zealand in 2019, made his Test debut in Australia in 2020 and is touted for big things in the future. He was however let go off by KKR ahead of the 2022 TATA IPL Auction. Gujarat Titans pounced on this opportunity to rope him in their side and could well be their opener this season. Gill has the flair and abilities of a top-class batter, and one won’t be surprised if he delivers for the Titans this season.</p>

        <p>After consistent performances since the inaugural edition of the IPL, India’s star opener Shikhar “Gabbar” Dhawan returned to his hometown to bolster the Delhi Capitals’ batting unit in 2019. After dominating the show with the bat, Dhawan has now moved to PBKS after being bought by the franchise for INR 8.25 Crore during the TATA IPL 2022 auction. Dhawan, a consistent run-getter in the competition, is the second-highest run-getter in the history of the IPL with 5784 runs to his name with the help of 2 hundred and 44 half-centuries. With the wealth of experience under his belt and a large chunk of runs against his name, the swashbuckling left-hander will be crucial to PBKS’ fortunes.</p>
